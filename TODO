TODO: Add a count for word occurrences:
        addWordToList => also increment some counter.

Needs to print three most popular suggestions.
        Given lst: number[] => find which has longest length.

Needs a different mode(?) for building sentences from suggestions.
  Given state: string[] =>
    return list of sentences with state[0] and then state[1]
